EXCESS OF VERIFICATION

'Rule 1: Extract the Second Sum' works

'Rule 2: First Excess Of Equivalent to Subtraction' works

'Rule 3: Push Through the First Sum' works

CAPITAL GAINS VERIFICATION

'Carryforward unused losses' works

'Statute v. Worksheet Long' works

'Statute v. Worksheet Short' works

'Carryforward unused losses require Net Capital Loss' does not work. A model in which that rule fails is 
 [LTCL = 100,
 STCG = 100,
 STCL = 200,
 LTCG = 100,
 Other_Income = 0]

'Statute v. Worksheet Long require Net Capital Loss' does not work. A model in which that rule fails is 
 [LTCL = 800,
 STCG = 100,
 STCL = 200,
 LTCG = 300,
 Other_Income = 200]

'Statute v. Worksheet Short require Net Capital Loss' does not work. A model in which that rule fails is 
 [LTCL = 200,
 STCG = 0,
 STCL = 1779700,
 LTCG = 1777400,
 Other_Income = -100]
