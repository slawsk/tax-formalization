## Reasoning with Formalized Statutes

This repository includes files with the code and verifications discussed in *Reasoning with Formalized Statutes: The Case of Capital Gains and Losses*. 

The repository includes 
- the [most recent draft](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/FormalizationReasoning.20231226.pdf) which is still very much in progress
- code with [the formalization](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/formalize_reasoning.py)
- the [output file](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/check.txt) with a result of running the program to verify the formalizations
- the (very small) [requirements.txt](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/requirements.txt) file for running this code
