This repository includes files with the code and verifications discussed in *Reasoning with Formalized Statutes: The Case of Capital Gains and Losses* (this respository includes the [most recent draft](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/FormalizationReasoning.20231226.pdf) which is still very much in progress).

The code includes the [definition of common functions used in the formalizations](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/formalization_rules.py), the [formalization and verification of the operational rules for "excess of"](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/excessofrules.py), and the [formalization and verification of the various claims related to capital gains and losses](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/formalize.py). There are also txt files with the outputs of running the programs to verify the formalizations.

The (very small) [requirements.txt](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/requirements.txt) file for running this code is also available.
