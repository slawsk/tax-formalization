## Reasoning with Formalized Statutes

This repository includes files with the code and verifications discussed in [*Reasoning with Formalized Statutes: The Case of Capital Gains and Losses*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4832255), 43 Virginia Tax Review 361 (2024). Specifically, here you can find:
- code with [the formalization](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/formalize_reasoning.py)
- the [output file](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/check.txt) with a result of running the program to verify the formalizations
- the [code that generates the graphs in the paper](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/capitalgainsgraphs.py) 
- the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/requirements.txt) file for running the verification and creating the graphs

You can also view [the graphs themselves, with verbal descriptions](https://www.sarahlawsky.org/formalizedreasoninggraphics).
