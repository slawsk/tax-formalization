This repository includes files with the code and verifications discussed in *Reasoning with Formalized Statutes: The Case of Capital Gains and Losses* (this respository includes the [most recent draft](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/FormalizationReasoning.20231226.pdf) which is still very much in progress).

The code includes the formalization as well as the output file with a result of running the program to verify the formalizations.

The (very small) [requirements.txt](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-formalization/blob/main/requirements.txt) file for running this code is also available.
